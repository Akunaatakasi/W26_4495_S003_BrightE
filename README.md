## Project Overview
This project presents an academic research prototype and simulation of a web-based Remote Emergency Room (ER) Triage and Telemedicine System. The system is designed to address emergency department overcrowding by enabling pre-hospital patient triage through a secure web interface that supports scenario-based patient intake, queue management, and clinician video consultation with human-in-the-loop overrides.

The project focuses on evaluating how remote triage and telemedicine technologies can improve patient flow, reduce wait times, and lower Left Without Being Seen (LWBS) rates while maintaining cybersecurity and privacy compliance.

## Objectives
- Analyze emergency department overcrowding and pre-hospital triage challenges.
- Design a web-based remote triage and telemedicine system architecture.
- Develop an academic research prototype with simulated patient scenarios.
- Implement queue-based and timestamp-driven patient flow simulations.
- Evaluate operational metrics such as wait time, throughput, and LWBS rates.
- Integrate cybersecurity and privacy-by-design principles into system design.

## Methodology
This project adopts a mixed-methods research approach that combines:
- Conceptual system design
- Academic software prototyping
- Scenario-based simulation using synthetic patient data

No real patient data is used. All evaluations are conducted through controlled simulations for academic purposes only.

## Technologies
- **Platform / OS:** Web-based (cross-platform)
- **Front-End:** React.js (conceptual prototype)
- **Back-End:** Node.js with RESTful APIs
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (simulated datasets)
- **Communication:** WebRTC (video consultation concept)
- **Security:** Role-based access control, authentication, encryption (conceptual)
- **Simulation Tools:** Timestamped queues and patient case modeling

## Folder Guide
- `/ReportsAndDocuments/` - For all reports and documentations
- `/Implementation/` - for all the code that will be checked in
- `/Misc/` - For any other files or folders

## Usage
Each folder contains documentation explaining its purpose, assumptions and methodology

## Ethics and Compliance
- No real patient data is collected or processed
- All Scenarios use synthetic data
- System design considers healthcare privacy and cybersecurity standards (PIPEDA/HIPAA PRINCIPLES)
- The project complies with academic integrity and ethical research guidelines
